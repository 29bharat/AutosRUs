## Challenge Part 1 - MechaCar_MPG
  
### Analysis
  
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  
The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance were Vehicle Length(2.60e-12) and Ground Clearance(5.21e-08).
  
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  
Slope(Intercept) cannot be considered zero because Coefficients Vehicle Length(2.60e-12) and Ground Clearance(5.21e-08) show a strong impact on the mpg of the vehicle.
  
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  
Yes, the linear model can be used to predict MechaCar prototypes as we have the R -squared value of 0.7149 which means about 71% of the variance can be explained for mpg by the predictor variables.
  
## Challenge Part 2 - Suspension Coil Summary
  
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?
  
The variance of the entire suspension coil dataset is 62.3 which falls below 100 pounds per inch limit. However, when we look at the summary of each lot we see that Lot 3 has significantly high variance of 170 compared to Lot 1(0.98) and Lot 2(7.47). We need to investigate what is different in Lot 3 data. With the current data we do not meet the design specification.
  
## Challenge Part 3 - Suspension Coil T Test
  
As per the two sided T-test on PSI of suspension coils dataset, we see that the sample tested has a mean of 1498.78 which is really close to 1500. Also, the P-value of 0.06 shows that results are not statistically different.

## Challenge Part 4 - Design Your Own Study
  
Two additional data points if added in the MechaCar dataset that we can use to help in our analysis are Horsepower(hp) and no. of Cylinders(cyl).
  
From our correlation analysis in this study, we have determined that the r-value between mpg and horsepower is -0.77, which is a strong negative correlation. Similarly, r-value between mpg and cyl is -0.85 which is again a strong negative correlation. Hence the analysis would be more efficient if we have these two data points added to the MechaCar dataset.
  
We can perform linear multi regression test to calculate the intercept and slope for each independent variable that we add. That way the R squared and p value will give an idea of correlation between the independent and mpg values.
